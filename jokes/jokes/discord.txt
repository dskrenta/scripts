The distinction between children and adults, while probably
useful for some purposes, is at bottom a specious one, I feel.

The state represents violence in a concentrated and organized

machine, it can never be weaned from violence to which it owes
its very existence.

Life is pain.  Those who say differently are selling something.

Death by violence, death by cold, death by starvation - they are

Eventually, one man may even be able to wield the destructive
power that only nation-states possess today.

The media is the most efficient weapon of tyranny and oppression
ever created.  No need to physically control populations

PSYOPS have evolved to the point, thanks to the all pervasive
mass media, where we can make you believe or at least passively
accept whatever we want you to.

Global government: power corrupts, complete power corrupts

The question of whether science can ever recover its innocence
is moot.  After life as a harlot on the mean streets of political
imperative, a return to the sanctity of the cloister looks out
of the question.  If so, humanity has forever lost a bright
jewel in its culture.

Only a fraction of mankind has emerged from the Dark Ages.

Giant planes throb through the stratosphere but half their

Global warming... is there *anything* it can't do?

What this country needs is a return to the stability consequent

When knowledgeable people can't agree on the best course of
action, there's no reason to think ignorance will get you to
a worse place than knowledge.  The only thing you can know for

As you know, fairness is a concept that was invented so that
children and idiots could participate in arguments.

Many textbooks make little or no attempt to distinguish fact

alternative view is possible).

It boggles the mind to think that until something like Jonestown
or Heaven's Gate happens no one has any interest in critical
thinking.  They don't teach it in schools.  It's not practiced
in our mass media.  It's so bad that anyone who does practice
it is considered weird, troublesome, the enemy of reason.

I refuse to mortgage my time here on earth for someone else's

There's no longer some lone guy standing on a street corner

The heretic is condemned because he has dared to question an
authority that must never be questioned.  Here, `overwhelming
evidence' serves as the equivalent of revealed religious truth
and those who question `scientists of unquestioned reputation'
- that is, the new priestly caste - are guilty of blasphemy.
%
The charge of denial has become a secular form of blasphemy.
%
Scepticism towards the received wisdom on global warming, or
public health issues such as AIDS, is described as `denial'
and today, `denial' has been transformed into a generic evil.

The dogmatic demand to `believe' has become a kind of moral
imperative.  Moral entrepreneurs argue that victims have,

The Soviet Union was the full fruit of Marxist ideology, the
realization of the great Utopian dream.
%
We describe therefore such stellar objects as if they were still
in existence in what the Media calls real time.  In other words
science is asking us to accept as real a total stage-construct

We have repeatedly come face to face with the obvious fact that

Increasingly insane directives from the all-powerful EU

Almost the entire political class has isolated itself not

Now the real reason this is all moot is because nobody in

I like that `settle it in the streets.'  Last time I looked,
the good guys still outnumber the common criminals, carjackers,

This system is an anti-system, a multilevel negation, built

The only thing that Representative Democracy has to recommend

Your head's like mine, like all our heads; big enough to contain

Intelligence is the capacity to receive, decode and transmit

Psychopaths routinely offer excuses for their reckless and

The notion that the government (and other parties) is interested

The power to travel through time is the power to create

Pathological processes have historically had a profound influence

Understanding the nature of macro-social pathology helps us to

The human organism is like an orchestra which is composed of

Anyone who can read history with both hemispheres of the brain

We are near a cultural stage where such is the level of media

The belief that human rights can be imposed by statue laws

Mind control is about convincing people to embrace a fantasy

because they've been persuaded it's easier to submit to authority
than to take control of their own lives.  Maybe it is but that

The real techniques of mind control are as old as civilisation
itself.  They work by tried and tested empirically derived
methods with the mind seen as a black box.  It is not necessary
to know how the human mind actually works as a system for these
techniques to be used and to work, it is if you're going to
use technology to control people like robots by use of implants

What the core globalist elite understand perfectly is their
own individual self interest and the true nature of the reality

The world of objective facts is a very small part of human

Get a clue people, can you not wake from your slumber and just
open your eyes?  *The government cannot protect you or the ones

We live in a magical reality, not a real world, in a collective
hallucination that fits our human cognitive processes and
enables us to relate to each other as humans.  That's not to
say there isn't a real world; but though we may see reality we
see through a glass, darkly.

It's like it says in the Bible: there is a real world, this is
not just all an illusion, it really happens and really matters
and there are real consequences for real people who are the same

Think how clever the average person is, now consider that half

The trouble with democracy is that 50 percent of the voters are
