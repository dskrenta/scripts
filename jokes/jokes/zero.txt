There aren't any GOOD guys. You realize that, don't you?
I mean: there aren't EVIL guys, and INNOCENT guys.
It's just - it's just... It's just a bunch of guys.

Now, a few words on looking for things.
When you go looking for something specific,
your chances of finding it are very bad.
Because of all the things in the world,
you're only looking for one of them.
When you go looking for anything at all,
your chances of finding it are very good.
Because of all the things in the world,
you're sure to find some of them.
