My friends, each of you is a single cell in the great body of the
state.  And today, that great body has purged itself of parasites.
We have triumphed over the unprincipled dissemination of facts.
The thugs and wreckers have been cast out and the poisonous
weeds of disinformation have been cosigned to the dustbin of
history.  Let each and every cell rejoice!  For today we
celebrate the first, glorious anniversary of the Information
Purification Directive.

We have created, for the first time in all history, a garden of
pure ideology, where each worker may bloom secure from the pests
of contradictory and confusing truths.  Our unification of thought
is a more powerful weapon than any fleet or army on earth!  We are
one people.  With one will.  One resolve.  One cause.  Our enemies
shall talk themselves to death, and we will bury them with their
own confusion.  We shall prevail!

The dogcow has no natural enemies, but the meager population
manages to keep itself in check through its own stupidity. They
have a nasty tendency to graze off cliffs (in fact, there are no
known "cliff-dwelling dogcows" left in existence) and to get lost
in the weeds. You've probably noticed that when you cut very high
grass, you tend to get a lot of "paper" in the grass clippings;
closer examination would show that much of it is actually dogcow.
When a mower approaches, dogcows often actually change their hide
to resemble newspaper as a final line of defense--hence the famous
expression, "black and white and read all over."
