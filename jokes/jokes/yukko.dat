                      'If You Are Unhappy'
     Once upon a time, there was a nonconforming sparrow who decided not
to fly south for the winter.  However, soon the weather turned so cold that
he reluctantly started to fly south.  In a short time, ice began to form
on his wings and he fell to earth in a barnyard; he was nearly frozen to
death.  A cow passed by and crapped on the little sparrow, and so the sparrow
thought it was the end.  However, the manure warmed him, and also defrosted
his wings.  Warm and happy, able to breathe, he started to sing.  Just then
a large cat came by, and hearing the chirping, investigated the sounds.
The cat cleaned away the manure, found the chirping bird, and promptly ate
him.

The moral of the story:
     1.  Everyone who shits on you is not necessarily your enemy.
     2.  Everyone who gets you out of the shit is not necessarily your friend.
     3.  Last but not least, if you are warm and happy in a pile of shit,
         keep your mouth shut.

        B)  Pretend you've forgotten how to speak English.

sometimes connote points along a continuum.  FROB connotes aimless
manipulation; TWIDDLE connotes gross manipulation, often a coarse
search for a proper setting; TWEAK connotes fine-tuning.  If someone is
turning a knob on an oscilloscope, then if he's carefully adjusting it
he is probably tweaking it; if he is just turning it but looking at the

Obvious, isn't it?
    Clearly the best thing you can do for you children is to start
speaking Yiddish right now and never speak another word of English as
long as you live.  This will, of course, entail teaching Yiddish to all
your friends, business associates, the people at the supermarket, and
so on, but that's just the point.  It has to start with committed
individuals and then grow....

             JACK AND THE BEANSTACK
              by Mark Isaak

    Long ago, in a finite state far away, there lived a JOVIAL
character named Jack.  Jack and his relations were poor.  Often their
hash table was bare.  One day Jack's parent said to him, "Our matrices
are sparse.  You must go to the market to exchange our RAM for some
BASICs."  She compiled a linked list of items to retrieve and passed it
to him.
    So Jack set out.  But as he was walking along a Hamilton path,
he met the traveling salesman.
    "Whither dost thy flow chart take thou?" prompted the salesman
in high-level language.
    "I'm going to the market to exchange this RAM for some chips
and Apples," commented Jack.
    "I have a much better algorithm.  You needn't join a queue
there; I will swap your RAM for these magic kernels now."
    Jack made the trade, then backtracked to his house.  But when
he told his busy-waiting parent of the deal, she became so angry she
started thrashing.
    "Don't you even have any artificial intelligence?  All these
kernels together hardly make up one byte," and she popped them out the
window...

        William Safire's Rules for Writers:

Remember to never split an infinitive.  The passive voice should never
be used.  Do not put statements in the negative form.  Verbs have to
agree with their subjects.  Proofread carefully to see if you words
out.  If you reread your work, you can find on rereading a great deal
of repetition can be avoided by rereading and editing.  A writer must
not shift your point of view.  And don't start a sentence with a
conjunction.  (Remember, too, a preposition is a terrible word to end a
sentence with.)  Don't overuse exclamation marks!!  Place pronouns as
close as possible, especially in long sentences, as of 10 or more
words, to their antecedents.  Writing carefully, dangling participles
must be avoided.  If any word is improper at the end of a sentence, a
linking verb is.  Take the bull by the hand and avoid mixing
metaphors.  Avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky.  Everyone should
be careful to use a singular pronoun with singular nouns in their
writing.  Always pick on the correct idiom.  The adverb always follows
the verb.  Last but not least, avoid cliches like the plague; seek
viable alternatives.

        THE CHURCH OF COUNTERFACTUAL BELIEF

An amalgamation of the Creation Science Research Foundation and the
Flat Earth Society, The Church of Counterfactual Belief has been set up
to cater to all who do not allow demonstrable truth to get in the way
of their beliefs.  In addition to creation science and the flatness of
the earth, the following beliefs have been certified by Pope Duane as
correct Church dogma:

    --  That there is a hole in the Earth at the North Pole from which
          UFOs come.
    --  That pi equals precisely 3.000.
    --  That sex can be enjoyed only by blacks and homosexuals.
    --  That Billy Joe Wilson (Hoopla, Miss.) has successfully squared
          the circle.
    --  That Harry Truman is still president, and doing a fine job.
    --  That pi equals precisely 22/7.

Several other important counterfactual beliefs are presently being
studied, including Reaganomics, A.I., and that the moon landings were
done in a Hollywood special effects studio.  These will be the subject
of a forthcoming Papal Bull.

>From "The Real Programmer's Handbook":
   1.  Real programmers don't write specs.  Users should
       consider themselves lucky to get any program at all
       and take what they can get.
%
>From "The Real Programmer's Handbook":
   2.  Real programmers don't comment their code.  If it
       was hard to write, it should be hard to understand.
%

Real software engineers don't read dumps.   They never generate them,
and on the rare occasions that they come across them, they are vaguely
amused.
%
Real software engineers don't comment their code.  The identifiers are so
mnemonic they don't have to.
%
Real software engineers don't write applications programs, they implement
algorithms.   If someone has an application that the algorithm might help
with, that's nice.  Don't ask them to write the user interface, though.
%
Real software engineers eat quiche.
%
If it doesn't have recursive function calls, real software engineers
don't program in it.
%
Real software engineers don't program in assembler.  They become queasy at the
very thought.
%
Real software engineers don't debug programs, they verify correctness.   This
process doesn't necessarily involve executing anything on a computer, except
perhaps a Correctness Verification Aid package.
%
Real software engineers like C's structured constructs, but they are suspicious
of it because they have heard that it lets you get "close to the machine."
%
Real software engineers play tennis.   In general, they don't like any sport
that involves getting hot and sweaty and gross when out of range of a shower.
(Thus mountain climbing is Right Out.)  They will occasionally wear their
tennis togs to work, but only on very sunny days.
%
Real software engineers admire PASCAL for its discipline and Spartan purity,
but they find it difficult to actually program in.   They don't tell this to
their friends, because they are afraid it means that they are somehow Unworthy.
%
Real software engineers work from 9 to 5, because that is the way the job is
described in the formal spec.   Working late would feel like using an
undocumented external procedure.
%
Real software engineers write in languages that have not actually been
implemented for any machine, and for which only the formal spec (in BNF) is
available.   This keeps them from having to take any machine dependencies
into account.  Machine dependencies make real software engineers very uneasy.
%
Real software engineers don't write in ADA, because the standards bodies have
not quite decided on a formal spec yet.
%
Real software engineers like writing their own compilers, preferably in
PROLOG (they also like writing them in unimplemented languages, but it turns
out to be difficult to actually RUN these).
%
Real software engineers regret the existence of COBOL, FORTRAN and BASIC.
PL/I is getting there, but it is not nearly disciplined enough; far too
much built in function.
%
Real software engineers aren't too happy about the existence of users,
either.   Users always seem to have the wrong idea about what the
implementation and verification of algorithms is all about.
%
Real software engineers don't like the idea of some inexplicable and greasy
hardware several aisles away that may stop working at any moment.  They have
a great distrust of hardware people, and wish that systems could be virtual
at ALL levels.   They would like personal computers (you know no one's going
to trip over something and kill your DFA in mid-transit), except that they
need 8 megabytes to run their Correctness Verification Aid packages.
%
Real software engineers think better while playing WFF 'N' PROOF.
%
Real computer scientists don't write code. They occasionally tinker with
'programming systems', but those are so high level that they hardly count
(and rarely count accurately; precision is for applications.)
%
Real computer scientists don't write the user interfaces, they merely
argue over what they should look like.
%
Real computer scientists don't eat quiche. They shun Schezuan food
since the hackers discovered it. Many real computer scientists consider
eating an implementation detail. (Others break down and eat with the
hackers, but only if they can have ice cream for desert.)
%
If it doesn't have a programming environment complete with interactive
debugger, structure editor and extensive cross module type checking,
real computer scientists won't be seen tinkering with it. They may
have to use it to balance their checkbooks, as their own systems can't.
%
Real computer scientists don't program in assembler.  They don't write in
anything less portable than a number two pencil.
%
Real computer scientists don't debug programs, they dynamically modify
them. This is safer, since no one has invented a way to do anything
dynamic to FORTRAN, COBOL or BASIC.
%
Real computer scientists play Go. They have nothing against the concept
of mountain climbing, but the actual climbing is an implementation
detail best left to programmers.
%
Real computer scientists admire ADA for its overwhelming aesthetic value,
but they find it difficult to actually program in, as it is much too
large to implement. Most Computer scientists don't notice this because
they are still arguing over what else to add to ADA.
%
Real computer scientists work from 5 pm to 9 am because that's the only
time they can get the 8 megabytes of main memory they need to edit
specs. (Real work starts around 2 am when enough MIPS are free for
their dynamic systems.) Real computer scientists find it hard to share
3081s when they are doing 'REAL' work.
%
Real computer scientists only write specs for languages that might run
on future hardware. Nobody trusts them to write specs for anything
homo sapiens will ever be able to fit on a single planet.
%
Real computer scientists like planning their own environments to use
bit mapped graphics. Bit mapped graphics is great because no one can
afford it, so their systems can be experimental.
%
Real computer scientists regret the existence of PL/I, PASCAL and LISP.
ADA is getting there, but it still allows people to make mistakes.
%
Real computer scientists despise the idea of actual hardware. Hardware
has limitations, software doesn't. It's a real shame that Turing machines
are so poor at I/O.

Jack and Jill worked together at a factory.  Due to a slump in business,
one of the two would have to be laid off, but the boss could not decide
which one he would let go, since they were both very hard workers.  He
decided that the next one who would go on a break would be the one that
he laid off.  Well, the end of the day came and neither one of them had
taken a break so the next day he decided that the first one who went
to the water cooler would be the one fired.  After a little while, both
of them went to get a drink together.  Not knowing what to do he called
Jill over and explained the problem to her and said that he was going

          A doctor, an architect, and a computer scientist were arguing
about whose profession was the oldest.  In the course of their
arguments, they got all the way back to the Garden of Eden, whereupon
the doctor said, "The medical profession is clearly the oldest, because
Eve was made from Adam's rib, as the story goes, and that was a simply
incredible surgical feat."
          The architect did not agree.  He said, "But if you look at the
Garden itself, in the beginning there was chaos and void, and out of
that, the Garden and the world were created.  So God must have been an
architect."
          The computer scientist, who had listened to all of this said,
"Yes, but where do you think the chaos came from?"

    And Mercy knelt a-weeping.
"Clear out!" he cried, "disordered wench!
    Nor come before me creeping.
Upon you knees if you appear,
'Tis plain you have no standing here."

Then Justice came.  His Honor cried:
    "YOUR states? -- Devil seize you!"
"Amica curiae," she replied --
    "Friend of the court, so please you."
"Begone!" he shouted -- "There's the door --
I never saw your face before!"

SIMPLE -- SIMPLE is an acronym for
Sheer Idiots Monopurpose Programming Linguistic Environment. This
language, developed at the Hanover College for Technological Misfits,

while they worked. Unfortunately, few programmers could survive there
for long, since the Center outlawed pizza and RC Cola in favor of bean
curd and Perrier.

Many mourn the demise of LAIDBACK because of its reputation as a
gentle and nonthreatening language. For example, LAIDBACK responded to

   CEREBRAL DARWINISM:  The theory that the effects of cerebral atrophy
   can be reversed through the purging action of heavy alcohol
   consumption.  Large amounts of alcohol cause many brain cells to
   perish due to oxygen deprivation.  Through the process of natural
   selection, the weak and sick brain cells will die first, leaving
   only the healthy cells.  This wonderful process leaves the imbiber
   with a healthier, more vibrant brain, and increases mental capacity.
   Thus, the devastating effects of cerebral atrophy are reversed, and
   academic performance actually increases beyond previous levels.

Dear Mr. Conners,
     Thank you for your letter of February 17th.  After careful consideration
I regret to inform you that I am unable to accept your refusal to offer me
employment with your bank.

     This year I have been particularly fortunate in receiving an unusually
large number of rejection letters.  With such a varied and promising field
of condidates it is impossible for me to accept all refusals.

     Despite Company 203's outstanding 	qualifications and previous
experience in rejecting applicants, I find that your rejection does not

In an interview with David Frost, Richard Nixon set an all-time high for
buck-passing while explaining how Watergate happened:

   "I'm convinced that if it hadn't been for Martha [Mitchell] and God rest
   her soul, because she, in her heart, was a good person.  She just had a
   mental and emotional problem that nobody knew about.  If it hadn't been
   for Martha, there'd have been no Watergate, because John wasn't minding
   that store.  He was letting Magruder and all these kids, these nuts,
   run this thing.  Now, am I saying here, at this juncture, that Watergate
   should be blamed on Martha Mitchell?  Of course not.  I'm trying to
   explain my feeling of compassion for my friend, John Mitchell."

do what you like guys, oh, but don't eat the apple.  Surprise surprise, they
eat it and he leaps out from behind a bush shouting 'Gotcha.'  It wouldn't
have made any difference if they hadn't eaten it."
   "Why not?"
   "Because if you're dealing with somebody who has the sort of mentality which
likes leaving hats on the pavement with bricks under them you know perfectly
well they won't give up.  They'll get you in the end."

Amie shyly stood up, scuffed her feet and said, ``My father is a

``Thank you, Amie.'' said the teacher.  ``What about your father,
Tim?''

Tim proudly stood up and announced, ``My daddy plays piano in a
whorehouse.''

The teacher was aghast and proptly changed the subject to geography.

Later that day she went to Tim's house and rang the bell.  Tim's

On the eve of her wedding night the bride-to-be confessed
to her best friend that - unbeknownst to her fiance - she
was not a virgin.  "No problem," said the friend.  "Go out
and buy a nice piece of liver and put it up inside of you
before the time comes.  You'll feel nice and tight, and he'll
never know the difference."
So the bride went ahead with the plan, and on their wedding
night, the couple went crazy.  They fucked on the floor, on
the kitchen table, in the bathroom, in the bed.  So the bride
was truly astonished to wake up the next morning to find her
new husband gone, the only trace of him a note on the
bedside table.  "Dearest," it read, "I love you very much,
but I've realized we can't go on like this and can never have
a life together.  Farewell.  P.S.: Your vagina is in the sink."

I went on to test the program in every way I could devise.  I strained
it to expose its weaknesses.  I ran it for high-mass stars and low-mass
stars, for stars born exceedingly hot and those born relatively cold.
I ran it assuming the superfluid currents beneath the crust to be
absent -- not because I wanted to know the answer, but because I had
developed an intuitive feel for the answer in this particular case.
Finally I got a run in which the computer showed the pulsar's
temperature to be less than absolute zero.  I had found an error.  I
chased down the error and fixed it.  Now I had improved the program to
the point where it would not run at all.

affection increases, the entertainment can be reduced proportionately.

The temperature of Heaven can be rather accurately computed.  Our
authority is Isaiah 30:26, "Moreover, the light of the Moon shall be as
the light of the Sun and the light of the Sun shall be sevenfold, as
the light of seven days."  Thus Heaven receives from the Moon as much
radiation as we do from the Sun, and in addition 7*7 (49) times as much
as the Earth does from the Sun, or 50 times in all.  The light we
receive from the Moon is one 1/10,000 of the light we receive from the
Sun, so we can ignore that ... The radiation falling on Heaven will
heat it to the point where the heat lost by radiation is just equal to
the heat received by radiation, i.e., Heaven loses 50 times as much
heat as the Earth by radiation.  Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for
radiation, (_H/_E)^4 = 50, where _E is the absolute temperature of the
earth (-300K), gives _H as 798K (525C).  The exact temperature of Hell
cannot be computed ... [However] Revelations 21:8 says "But the
fearful, and unbelieving ... shall have their part in the lake which
burneth with fire and brimstone."  A lake of molten brimstone means
that its temperature must be at or below the boiling point, 444.6C.  We
have, then, that Heaven, at 525C is hotter than Hell at 445C.

rabbit.
        "Come now, friend rabbit, you know that's impossible!"
        "Well, follow me and I'll show you." They both go into the
rabbit's dwelling and after a while the rabbit emerges with a satisfied
expression on his face.
        Comes along a wolf.  "Hello, what are we doing these days?"
        "I'm writing the second chapter of my thesis, on how rabbits
devour wolves."
        "Are you crazy?  Where is your academic honesty?"
        "Come with me and I'll show you." As before, the rabbit comes
out with a satisfied look on his face and a diploma in his paw.
Finally, the camera pans into the rabbit's cave and, as everybody
should have guessed by now, we see a mean-looking, huge lion sitting
next to some bloody and furry remnants of the wolf and the fox.

The moral: It's not the contents of your thesis that are important --
it's your PhD advisor that really counts.

After [Benjamin] Franklin came a herd of Electrical Pioneers whose
names have become part of our electrical terminology: Myron Volt, Mary
Louise Amp, James Watt, Bob Transformer, etc.  These pioneers conducted
many important electrical experiments.  For example, in 1780 Luigi
Galvani discovered (this is the truth) that when he attached two
different kinds of metal to the leg of a frog, an electrical current
developed and the frog's leg kicked, even though it was no longer
attached to the frog, which was dead anyway.  Galvani's discovery led
to enormous advances in the field of amphibian medicine.  Today,
skilled veterinary surgeons can take a frog that has been seriously
injured or killed, implant pieces of metal in its muscles, and watch it
hop back into the pond just like a normal frog, except for the fact
that it sinks like a stone.

Let's talk about how to fill out your 1984 tax return.  Here's an often
overlooked accounting technique that can save you thousands of dollars:
For several days before you put it in the mail, carry your tax return
around under your armpit.  No IRS agent is going to want to spend hours
poring over a sweat-stained document.  So even if you owe money, you
can put in for an enormous refund and the agent will probably give it
to you, just to avoid an audit.  What does he care?  It's not his
money.

Tertullian was born in Carthage somewhere about 160 A.D.  He was a
pagan, and he abandoned himself to the lascivious life of his city
until about his 35th year, when he became a Christian .... To him is
ascribed the sublime confession: Credo quia absurdum est (I believe
because it is absurd).  This does not altogether accord with historical
fact, for he merely said:

        "And the Son of God died, which is immediately credible because
        it is absurd.  And buried he rose again, which is certain
        because it is impossible."

Thanks to the acuteness of his mind, he saw through the poverty of
philosophical and Gnostic knowledge, and contemptuously rejected it.

	On their first date, Joe took Rose to the carnival. When he asked her
what she wanted to do first, Rose replied, "Get weighed."
	So Joe took her to the man with the scale who guesses your weight. He
looked at Rose and said, "One hundred and twenty pounds." Since Rose weighed
in at one seventeen, she collected a prize.
	Next they went on the roller coaster. When the ride was finished, Joe
asked Rose what she wanted to do next. "Get weighed," she said. So they went
back to the man with the scale, who of course guessed Rose's weight correctly.
Leaving without a prize, they went for a ride on the merry-go-round. After
they got off, Joe asked Rose what she wanted to do next. "I want to get
weighed!" she said again.
	Now Joe began to think this girl was quite strange, and decided to end
the evening quickly. He left her at the door with a quick handshake.

One fatal crash where alerting systems did not do the job as intended
involved a Mexican airliner.  The aircraft was in a descent (possibly
unknown to the crew) that unchecked would lead to ground contact.  The
alerter sounded its preliminary warning ("glide slope") followed by the
imperative "PULL-UP, PULL-UP".  The warning was viewed as erroneous by the
flight crew; the last words on the cockpit voice recorder were "aw, shut-up

	A man is visiting a farmer on his farm and the farmer offers to show
him around.  They wander around past the horses and the cows and the pig pen,
and the man sees one large pig all by itself in the corner, and it's only got
three legs.  So he turns to the farmer and says "How come that pig's only got
three legs?"

	"Well," says the farmer, "'bout a month ago I was sittin' on the
porch an' my little daughter Sarah was playin' in the yard.  It was a hot
day, mind you, and I drifted off to sleep.  All of the sudden I was woke up
by this screech and I seen poor little Sarah had wandered into the street and
was about to be hit by this big pickup.  This here pig came chargin' out of
the pen faster than I ever coulda moved and knocked Sarah out of the way just
in time."
	"Oh, " says the man, "and he got hit and lost his leg."
	"Nope," says the farmer.  "'Bout two weeks later, we was all asleep
in the house over yonder when somehow the place caught fire.  We woulda slept
right up until we'dve been trapped, 'cept for this pig which jumped the fence
brooke down the back door.  Flames everywhere, and he charged up the stairs
and woke us all up and pushed us out the window.  But he's too big to fit an'

		OF Auxiliary, Mixed, and National Arms

The second sort of unprofitable arms are auxiliaries, by whom I mean, troops
brought to help and protect you by a potentate whom you summon to your aid;

Auxiliaries may be excellent and useful soldiers for themselves, but are
always hurtful to him who calls them in; for if they are defeated, he is
undone, if victorious, he becomes their prisoner.  . . .

	You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below you is an
active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging out,
cascading back down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the farthest
reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving everything an eerie,
macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickering sparks of ash and a
heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to the touch, and the thundering
of the volcano drowns out all other sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far
overhead are myriad twisted formations composed of pure white alabaster, which
scatter the murky light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side
is a deep gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to
have been crafted by the Devil himself.  An immense river of fire crashes out
from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the gorge, and plummets
into a bottomless pit far off to your left.  To the right, an immense geyser
of blistering steam erupts continuously from a barren island in the center of a
sulfurous lake, which bubbles ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an
incandescence of its own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the

     Turning and turning in the widening gyre
     The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
     Things fall apart: the centre cannot hold;
     Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
     The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
     The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
     The best lack all conviction, while the worst
     Are filled with a passionate intensity.

     Surely some revelation is at hand;
     Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
     The Second Coming!  Hardly are those words out
     When a vast image out of SPIRITUS MUNDI
     Troubles my sight: somewhere in the sands of the desert
     A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
     A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
     Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
     Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
     The darkness drops again: but now I know
     That twenty centuries of stony sleep
     Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
     And what rough beast, its hour now come at last

    Catch a fly. Put it in the freezer compartment of your refrigerator for
    5 to 10 minutes. This slows him down considerably, so he's easier to
    handle. While he's in there, make a miniature paper airplane with a
    wing-span about double that of the fly. Take the cool dude out of the
    ice-box and super glue his tiny feet onto the upper surface of the paper
    airplane. As he warms up and revives, he will begin doing that most
    natural of all fly activities: he will try to fly. If you have not made
    your little airplane too heavy, the fly's wing beats will be adequate
    for lift off. However, carrying the added weight quickly tires the fly,
    so in mid-air, he will stop beating his wings, and the airplane will
    soar downward. Seeing his plight causes the fly to once again attempt to
    fly, with the same result. Little bursts of energy as the plane gains
    altitude, alternated with slow downward glides. A thread super glued to
    the plane will keep your aerial circus in the same room, or you can take
    your new pet fly out for a walk, er, fly.

    In accepting an honorary degree from the University of Notre Dame a few
years ago, General David Sarnoff [head of RCA] made this statement: "We are
too prone to make technological instruments the scapegoats for the sins of
those who wield them.  The products of modern science are not in themselves
good or bad; it is the way they are used that determines their value."  That
is the voice of the current somnambulism.  Suppose we were to say, "Apple pie
is in itself neither good nor bad; it is the way it is used that determines
its value." ...  There is nothing in the Sarnoff statement that will bear
scrutiny, for it ignores the nature of the medium, of any and all media, in
the true Narcissus style of one hypnotized by the amputation and extension of
his own being in a new technical form. ... It has never occurred to General
Sarnoff that any technology could do anything but _add_ itself on to what we
already are.

    UNIX Shell is the Best Fourth Generation Programming Language

    It is the UNIX shell that makes it possible to do applications in a small
    fraction of the code and time it takes in third generation languages.  In
    the shell you process whole files at a time, instead of only a line at a
    time.  And, a line of code in the UNIX shell is one or more programs,
    which do more than pages of instructions in a 3GL.  Applications can be
    developed in hours and days, rather than months and years with traditional
    systems.  Most of the other 4GLs available today look more like COBOL or
    RPG, the most tedious of the third generation languages.

   In modern Europe, as in ancient Greece, it would seem that even inanimate
objects have sometimes been punished for their misdeeds.  After the revocation
of the edict of Nantes, in 1685, the Protestant chapel at La Rochelle was
condemned to be demolished, but the bell, perhaps out of regard for its value,
was spared.  However, to expiate the crime of having rung heretics to prayers,
it was sentenced to be first whipped, and then buried and disinterred, by way
of symbolizing its new birth at passing into Catholic hands.  Thereafter it
was catechized, and obliged to recant and promise that it would never again
relapse into sin.  Having made this ample and honourable amends, the bell was
reconciled, baptized, and given, or rather sold, to the parish of St.
Bartholomew.  But when the governer sent in the bill for the bell to the
parish authorities, they declined to settle it, alleging that the bell, as
a recent convert to Catholicism, desired to take advantage of the law lately
passed by the king, which allowed all new converts a delay of three years in
paying their debts.

And now that we have a real head start, you'll never catch us!  What better

a burning car.  "Dial 'one'!  Get room service!  Code red!"  Stiggs was on
the phone immediately, ordering more rose blossoms, because, according to
him, the ones floating in the tub had suddenly lost their smell.  "I demand
smell," he shrilled.  "I expecting total uninterrupted smell from these
f*cking roses."

  Unfortunately, the service captain didn't realize that the Stiggs situation
involved fifty roses.  "What am I going to do with this?" Stiggs sneered at
the weaseling hotel goon when he appeared at our door holding a single flower
floating in a brandy glass.  Stiggs's tirade was great.  "Do you see this
bathtub?  Do you notice any difference between the size of the tub and the
size of that spindly wad of petals in your hand?  I need total bath coverage.
I need a completely solid layer of roses all around me like puffing factories
of smell, attacking me with their smell and power-ramming big stinking
concentrations of rose odor up my nostrils until I'm wasted with pleasure."

  "Oh, it's true.  I know your race.  It is made up of sheep.  It is governed
by minorities, seldom or never by majorities.  It suppresses its feelings and
its beliefs and follows the handful that makes the most noise.  Sometimes the
noisy handful is right, sometimes wrong; but no matter, the crowd follows it.
The vast majority of the race, whether savage or civilized, are secretly kind-
hearted and shrink from inflicting pain, but in the presence of the aggressive
and pitiless minority they don't dare to assert themselves.  Think of it!  One
kind-hearted creature spies upon another, and sees to it that he loyally helps
in iniquities which revolt both of them.  Speaking as an expert, I know that
ninety-nine out of a hundred of your race were strongly against the killing of
witches when that foolishness was first agitated by a handful of pious lunatics
in the long ago.  And I know that even to-day, after ages of transmitted
prejudice and silly teaching, only one person in twenty puts any real heart
into the harrying of a witch.  And yet apparently everybody hates witches and
wants them killed.  Some day a handful will rise up on the other side and make
the most noise -- perhaps even a single daring man with a big voice and a
determined front will do it -- and in a week all the sheep will wheel and
follow him, and witch-hunting will come to a sudden end."

  Next we had Egyptian wars, Greek wars, Roman wars, hideous drenchings of the
earth with blood; and we saw the treacheries of the Romans toward the Cartha-
ginians, and the sickening spectacle of the massacre of those brave people.
Also we saw Caesar invade Britain -- "not that those barbarians had done him
any harm, but because he wanted their land, and desired to confer the blessings
of civilization upon their widows and orphans," as Satan explained.
  Next, Christianity was born.  Then ages of Europe passed in review before us,
and we saw Christianity and Civilization march hand in hand through those ages,
"leaving famine and death and desolation in their wake, and other signs of the
progress of the human race," as Satan observed.
  And always we had wars, and more wars, and still other wars -- all over
Europe, all over the world.  "Sometimes in the private interest of royal
families," Satan said, "sometimes to crush a weak nation; but never a war
started by the aggressor for any clean purpose -- there is no such war in the
history of the race."
  "Now," said Satan, "you have seen your progress down to the present, and you
must confess that it is wonderful -- in its way.  We must now exhibit the
future."
  He showed us slaughters more terrible in their destruction of life, more
devastating in their engines of war, than any we had seen.
  "You perceive," he said, "that you have made continual progress.  Cain did
his murder with a club; the Hebrews did their murders with javelins and swords;
the Greeks and Romans added protective armor and the fine arts of military
organization and generalship; the Christian has added guns and gunpowder; a
few centuries from now he will have so greatly improved the deadly effectiveness
of his weapons of slaughter that all men will confess that without Christian
civilization war must have remained a poor and trifling thing to the end of
time."

of understanding"; that anything actually matters in the larger
universe; and that understanding anything could be important outside
of our own selfish whims and desire to survive. ...and somehow, because
it is important, understanding can go on without us, waiting only
to be rediscovered by the future, or at worst, pissed away, in spite
of all our prayers, and work, and suffering.

 is the primary motivator of regulatory legislation.  And indeed the
 evidence shows that consumers rarely engage in campaigns to license

"Pseudocode can be used to some extent to aid the maintenance
 process.  However, pseudocode that is highly detailed -
 approaching the level of detail of the code itself - is not of
 much use as maintenance documentation.  Such detailed
 documentation has to be maintained almost as much as the code,
 thus doubling the maintenance burden.  Furthermore, since such
 voluminous pseudocode is too distracting to be kept in the
 listing itself, it must be kept in a separate folder.  The
 result: Since pseudocode - unlike real code - doesn't have to be
 maintained, no one will maintain it.  It will soon become out of
 date and everyone will ignore it.  (Once, I did an informal
 survey of 42 shops that used pseudocode.  Of those 42, 0 [zero!],
 found that it had any value as maintenance documentation."

 biennial elections would naturally produce in both houses?  Is it
 presumable that every man the instant he took his seat in the national

"The stars are made of the same atoms as the earth."  I usually pick one small
 topic like this to give a lecture on.  Poets say science takes away from the
 beauty of the stars -- mere gobs of gas atoms.  Nothing is "mere."  I too can
 see the stars on a desert night, and feel them.  But do I see less or more?
 The vastness of the heavens stretches my imagination -- stuck on this carousel
 my little eye can catch one-million-year-old light.  A vast pattern -- of which
 I am a part -- perhaps my stuff was belched from some forgotten star, as one
 is belching there.  Or see them with the greater eye of Palomar, rushing all
 apart from some common starting point when they were perhaps all together.
 What is the pattern, or the meaning, or the *why?*  It does not do harm to the
 mystery to know a little about it.  For far more marvelous is the truth than
 any artists of the past imagined!  Why do the poets of the present not speak
 of it?  What men are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were like a man, but

 independent thought about this question, Neil Armstrong and I concluded that
 it takes a coincidence of four conditions, or in Neil's view, the simultaneous
 peaking of four of the many cycles of American life. First, a base of
 technology must exist from which to do the thing to be done. Second, a period
 of national uneasiness about America's place in the scheme of human activities
 must exist. Third, some catalytic event must occur that focuses the national
 attention upon the direction to proceed.  Finally, an articulate and wise
 leader must sense these first three conditions and put forth with words and
 action the great thing to be accomplished. The motivation of young Americans
 to do what needs to be done flows from such a coincidence of conditions....

...And no philosophy, sadly, has all the answers.  No matter how assured
we may be about certain aspects of our belief, there are always painful
inconsistencies, exceptions, and contradictions.  This is true in religion as
it is in politics, and is self-evident to all except fanatics and the naive.
As for the fanatics, whose number is legion in our own time, we might be
advised to leave them to heaven.  They will not, unfortunately, do us the
same courtesy.  They attack us and each other, and whatever their
protestations to peaceful intent, the bloody record of history makes clear
that they are easily disposed to restore to the sword.  My own belief in
God, then, is just that -- a matter of belief, not knowledge.  My respect
for Jesus Christ arises from the fact that He seems to have been the
most virtuous inhabitant of Planet Earth.  But even well-educated Christians
are frustrated in their thirst for certainty about the beloved figure
of Jesus because of the undeniable ambiguity of the scriptural record.
Such ambiguity is not apparent to children or fanatics, but every
recognized Bible scholar is perfectly aware of it.  Some Christians, alas,
resort to formal lying to obscure such reality.

There is a difference, and this is a difference, we might say, between
prejudice and postjudice.  Prejudice is making a judgment before you have
looked at the facts.  Postjudice is making a judgment afterwards.  Prejudice
is terrible, in the sense that you commit injustices and you make serious
mistakes.  Postjudice is not terrible.  You can't be perfect of course; you
may make mistakes also.  But it is permissible to make a judgment after you
have examined the evidence.  In some circles it is even encouraged.

AN EXPOSTULATION (Against too many writers of science fiction)

Why did you lure us on like this,
Light-year on light-year, through the abyss,
Building (as though we cared for size!)
Empire that cover galaxies,
If at journey's end we find
The same old stuff we left behind,
Well-worn Tellurian stories of
Crooks, spies, conspirators, or love,
Whose setting might as well have been
The Bronx, Montmartre, or Bethnel Green?

Why should I leave this green floored cell,
Roofed with blue air, in which we dwell,
Unless, outside its guarded gates,
Long, long desired, the Unearthly waits,
Strangeness that moves us more than fear,
Beauty that stabs with tingling spear,
Or Wonder, laying on one's heart
That finger tip at which we start
As if some thought too swift and shy
For some reason's grasp had just gone by?

All religions have in common the periodical childlike surrender to a
Provider or providers who dispense earthly fortune as well as spiritual
health; some demonstrations of man's smallness by means of reduced
posture and humble gesture, the admission in prayer and song of misdeeds,
of misthoughts, and of evil intentions; fervent appeal for inner uni-
fication by divine guidance; and finally, the insight that individual
trust must become part of the ritual practice of man, and must become
a sign of trustworthiness in the community.

Already the spirit of our schooling is permeated with the feeling that
every subject, every topic, every fact, every professed truth must be
submitted to a certain publicity and impartiality.  All proffered
samples of learning must go to the same assay-room and be subjected to
common tests.  It is the essence of all dogmatic faiths to hold that
any such "show-down" is sacrilegious and perverse.  The characteristic
of religion, from their point of view, is that it is intellectually
secret, not public; peculiarly revealed, not generally known;
authoritatively declared, not communicated and tested in ordinary
ways...It is pertinent to point out that, as long as religion is
conceived as it is now by the great majority of professed religionists,
there is something self-contradictory in speaking of education in
religion in the same sense in which we speak of education in topics
where the method of free inquiry has made its way.  The "religious"
would be the last to be willing that either the history of the
content of religion should be taught in this spirit; while those
to whom the scientific standpoint is not merely a technical device,
but is the embodiment of the integrity of mind, must protest against
its being taught in any other spirit.

An Animal that knows who it is, one that has a sense of his own identity, is
a discontented creature, doomed to create new problems for himself for the
duration of his stay on this planet.  Since neither the mouse nor the chip
knows what is, he is spared all the vexing problems that follow this
discovery.  But as soon as the human animal who asked himself this question
emerged, he plunged himself and his descendants into an eternity of doubt
and brooding, speculation and truth-seeking that has goaded him through the
centuries as relentlessly as hunger or sexual longing.  The chimp that does
not know that he exists is not driven to discover his origins and is spared
the tragic necessity of contemplating his own end.  And even if the animal
experimenters succeed in teaching a chimp to count one hundred bananas or
to play chess, the chimp will develop no science and he will exhibit no
appreciation of beauty, for the greatest part of man's wisdom may be traced
back to the eternal questions of beginnings and endings, the quest to give
meaning to his existence, to life itself.

And it does matter.  An honest man or woman is an honest man or woman more
because he or she is honest in the small, everyday things that "don't matter"
individually, but which make up a well-lived life, than because of some single
great temptation that was passed.  A person who is concerned about individual
rights or about individual dignity makes his or her difference not because of
any sweeping great statement or action, but because of the accretion of small,
individually seemingly insignificant acts that spread that dignity and confirm
those rights through every action they take.  It matters because every action
you take, and every action I take is an expression of the human spirit.

As I argued in "Beloved Son", a book about my son Brian and the subject
of religious communes and cults, one result of proper early instruction
in the methods of rational thought will be to make sudden mindless
conversions -- to anything -- less likely.  Brian now realizes this and
has, after eleven years, left the sect he was associated with.  The
problem is that once the untrained mind has made a formal commitment to
a religious philosophy -- and it does not matter whether that philosophy
is generally reasonable and high-minded or utterly bizarre and
irrational -- the powers of reason are surprisingly ineffective in
changing the believer's mind.

As Lisa hugged me, I started humming the theme song from the State Farm
Insurance TV commercial.  This is not because I am in any way a slave to
television -- it had to do instead with a strategy I had concocted for
torturing Lisa on her wedding day.  What I planned to do was to plant the
State Farm Insurance jingle subliminally in Lisa's mind, until she retched.
The State Farm Insurance jingle had an almost satanic sticking power.  Lisa
wouldn't be able to hum or even think about anything else but the State Farm
Insurance jingle for weeks.  Soon she would suffer a terrific nervous
breakdown -- the Big NB, as Lisa called it -- and spend the rest of her life
spiking volleyballs off the roof of a mental hospital.

"Like a good neighbor," I hummed softly, "State Farm is there."  Lisa didn't
seem to notice, but I could tell I had done some first-rate subliminal damage,
since she hummed the last two words along with me.  I had planted the first
seed.

Crystals are the subject of international fascination.  From crystal balls to
lasers, they have been prized in healing and science throughout the centuries.
Now Randall and Vicki Baer explore completely new horizons of crystal-based
knowledge.

Building on the foundation of their popularly acclaimed book, _Windows of
Light_, the Baers explore techniques, tools, and technologies for personal
and planetary transformation.  They detail advanced techniques for using
crystals in such areas as healing, stress management, mind-center activation,
and telethought communication, and they demonstrate the unification of the
spiritual and the scientific in a light-based sacred science.

The Baers explore visions of a new age based on higher planes of reality
and ultra-advanced crystal technologies.  An essential reference, _The
Crystal Connection_ is a landmark achievement in the field of crystal-based
sacred science.

Randall and Vicki Baer are internationally known authorities in the areas
of crystals, sacred science, and spiritual teachings.  Widely sought as
speakers, they are codirectors of the Starcrest Academy of Interdimensional
Law and Science, a project dedicated to worldwide seminars and advanced
educational programs in the sacred sciences.  They are the authors of
_Windows of Light: Quartz Crystals and Self-Transformation_, considered
the best work on the subject to date.

Darwin was the great expansionism.  He shocked the world by arguing
convincingly that life is the creation of an autonomous process so simple that
it can be understood with just a moment of reflection.  No equations, photons
or computer read-outs required.  I can all be summarized in a couple of lines:
new variations in the hereditary material arise continuously, some survive and
reproduce better that others, and as a result organic evolution occurs.  And
even more briefly as follows: natural selection acting on mutations produces
evolution. Given enough time (and the Earth is over four billion years old)
even radically new kinds of organisms can be assembled this way, insects from
myriapods, amphibians from lungfish, birds from small dinosaurs, and even life
from inanimate matter.

Horizontal fragmentation results from market manipulation, the whim
of vendors, sheer incompetence, contempt for users, or the inability
of rival vendors to communicate. I'm talking about nonsense like
having 50 MS-DOS programs that each somehow find a different function
key to provide on-line help. I'm talking about differences between
products that make them incompatible and inconsistent while providing
no clear-cut technical advantage. Horizontal fragmentation vastly
increases the intellectual burden separating computer users from
solving their problems. Since it decreases the value of the computer
to the user while providing no offsetting benefit, it makes the
computer market smaller. This must eventually translate on average
into smaller paychecks for everyone who has tied their fortune to that
market.

However, on religious issues there can be little or no compromise.
There is no position on which people are so immovable as their religious
beliefs.  There is no more powerful ally one can claim in a debate than
Jesus Christ, or God, or Allah, or whatever one calls this supreme being.
But like any powerful weapon, the use of God's name on one's behalf
should be used sparingly.  The religious factions that are growing
throughout our land are not using their religious clout with wisdom.
They are trying to force government leaders into following their position
100 percent.  If you disagree with these religious groups on a
particular moral issue, they complain, they threaten you with a loss of
money or votes or both.  I'm frankly sick and tired of the political
preachers across this country telling me as a citizen that if I want to be
a moral person, I must believe in "A," "B," "C," and "D."  Just who do
they think they are?  And from where do they presume to claim the
right to dictate their moral beliefs to me?  And I am even more angry as
a legislator who must endure the threats of every religious group who
thinks it has some God-granted right to control my vote on every roll
call in the Senate.  I am warning them today:  I will fight them every
step of the way if they try to dictate their moral convictions to all
Americans in the name of "conservatism."

I believe that part of what propels science is the thirst for wonder.  It's a
very powerful emotion.  All children feel it.  In a first grade classroom
everybody feels it; in a twelfth grade classroom almost nobody feels it, or
at least acknowledges it.  Something happens between first and twelfth grade,
and it's not just puberty.  Not only do the schools and the media not teach
much skepticism, there is also little encouragement of this stirring sense
of wonder.  Science and pseudoscience both arouse that feeling.  Poor
popularizations of science establish an ecological niche for pseudoscience.

I did cancel one performance in Holland where they thought my music was so easy
that they didn't rehearse at all.  And so the first time when I found that out,
I rehearsed the orchestra myself in front of the audience of 3,000 people and
the next day I rehearsed through the second movement -- this was the piece
_Cheap Imitation_ -- and they then were ashamed.  The Dutch people were ashamed
and they invited me to come to the Holland festival and they promised to
rehearse.  And when I got to Amsterdam they had changed the orchestra, and
again, they hadn't rehearsed.  So they were no more prepared the second time
than they had been the first.  I gave them a lecture and told them to cancel
the performance; they then said over the radio that i had insisted on their
canceling the performance because they were "insufficiently Zen."

I have sacrificed time, health, and fortune, in the desire to complete these
Calculating Engines.  I have also declined several offers of great personal
advantage to myself.  But, notwithstanding the sacrifice of these advantages
for the purpose of maturing an engine of almost intellectual power, and after
expending from my own private fortune a larger sum than the government of
England has spent on that machine, the execution of which it only commenced,
I have received neither an acknowledgment of my labors, not even the offer
of those honors or rewards which are allowed to fall within the reach of men
who devote themselves to purely scientific investigations...

If the work upon which I have bestowed so much time and thought were a mere
triumph over mechanical difficulties, or simply curious, or if the execution
of such engines were of doubtful practicability or utility, some justification
might be found for the course which has been taken; but I venture to assert
that no mathematician who has a reputation to lose will ever publicly express
an opinion that such a machine would be useless if made, and that no man
distinguished as a civil engineer will venture to declare the construction of
such machinery impracticable...

And at a period when the progress of physical science is obstructed by that
exhausting intellectual and manual labor, indispensable for its advancement,
which it is the object of the Analytical Engine to relieve, I think the
application of machinery in aid of the most complicated and abstruse
calculations can no longer be deemed unworthy of the attention of the country.
In fact, there is no reason why mental as well as bodily labor should not
be economized by the aid of machinery.

I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradictions to the sentiments of
others, and all positive assertion of my own.  I even forbade myself the use
of every word or expression in the language that imported a fixed opinion,
such as "certainly", "undoubtedly", etc.   I adopted instead of them "I
conceive", "I apprehend", or "I imagine" a thing to be so or so; or "so it
appears to me at present".

When another asserted something that I thought an error, I denied myself the
pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing him immediately some
absurdity in his proposition.  In answering I began by observing that in
certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the present
case there appeared or seemed to me some difference, etc.

I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations I
engaged in went on more pleasantly.  The modest way in which I proposed my
opinions procured them a readier reception and less contradiction.  I had
less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily
prevailed with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I
happened to be in the right.

If a reasonable launch schedule is to be maintained, engineering often cannot
be done fast enough to keep up with the expectations of the originally con-
servative certification criteria designed to guarantee a very safe vehicle.
In such situations, safety criteria are altered subtly -- and with often
apparently logical arguments -- so that flights can still be certified in
time.  The shuttle therefore flies in a relatively unsafe condition, with
a chance of failure on the order of a percent.  (It is difficult to be more
accurate.) ...

Let us make recommendations to ensure that NASA officials deal in a world of
reality, understanding technological weaknesses and imperfections well enough
to be actively trying to eliminate them.  They must live in a world of reality
in comparing the costs and utility of the shuttle to other methods of entering
space.  And they must be realistic in making contracts and in estimating the
costs and difficulties of each project.  Only realistic flights schedules
should be proposed -- schedules that have a reasonable chance of being met.
If in this way the government would not support NASA, then so be it.  NASA
owes it to the citizens from whom it asks support to be frank, honest, and
informative, so that these citizens can make the wisest decisions for the use
of their limited resources.

For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public
relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.

If science were explained to the average person in a way that is accessible
and exciting, there would be no room for pseudoscience.  But there is a kind
of Gresham's Law by which in popular culture the bad science drives out the
good.  And for this I think we have to blame, first, the scientific community
ourselves for not doing a better job of popularizing science, and second, the
media, which are in this respect almost uniformly dreadful.  Every newspaper
in America has a daily astrology column.  How many have even a weekly
astronomy column?  And I believe it is also the fault of the educational

In Lisbon when heretics were publicly burned, it sometimes happened that one of
them, by particularly edifying recantation, would be granted the boon of being
strangled before being put into the flames.  This would make the spectators so
furious that the authorities had great difficulty in preventing them from
lynching the penitent and burning him on their own account.  The spectacle of
the writhing torments of the victims was, in fact, one of the principal
pleasures to which the populace looked forward to enliven a somewhat drab
existence.  I cannot doubt that this pleasure greatly contributed to the
general belief that the burning of heretics was a righteous act.  The same sort
of thing applies to war.  People who are vigorous and brutal often find war
enjoyable, provided that it is a victorious war and their is not too much
interference with rape and plunder.  This is a great help in persuading people

It is a very humbling experience to make a multimillion-dollar mistake, but it
is also very memorable.  I vividly recall the night we decided how to organize
the actual writing of external specifications for OS/360.  The manager of
architecture, the manager of control program implementation, and I were
threshing out the plan, schedule, and division of responsibilities.

The architecture manager had 10 good men.  He asserted that they could write
the specifications and do it right.  It would take ten months, three more
than the schedule allowed.

The control program manager had 150 men.  He asserted that they could prepare
the specifications, with the architecture team coordinating; it would be
well-done and practical, and he could do it on schedule.  Furthermore, if
the architecture team did it, his 150 men would sit twiddling their thumbs
for ten months.

To this the architecture manager responded that if I gave the control program
team the responsibility, the result would not in fact be on time, but would
also be three months late, and of much lower quality.  I did, and it was.  He
was right on both counts.  Moreover, the lack of conceptual integrity made
the system far more costly to build and change, and I would estimate that it
added a year to debugging time.

assumption will have to be rejected.  But it is important also to see that we
have not reached that day yet: the working assumption is a necessary one and
there is no real evidence opposed to it.  Our failure to solve a problem so
far does not make it insoluble.  One cannot logically be a determinist in

Newton realized that, according to his theory of gravity, the stars should
attract each other, so it seemed they could not remain essentially motionless.
Would they not all fall together at some point?  In a letter in 1691 to
Richard Bentley, another leading thinker of his day, Newton argued that this
would indeed happen if there were only a finite number of stars distributed
over a finite region of space.  But he reasoned that if, on the other hand,
there were an infinite number of stars, distributed more or less uniformly
over infinite space, this would not happen, because there would not be
any central point for them to fall to.

This argument is an instance of the pitfalls that you can encounter in

One of the major difficulties Trillian experienced in her relationship with
Zaphod was learning to distinguish between him pretending to be stupid just
to get people off their guard, pretending to be stupid because he couldn't
be bothered to think and wanted someone else to do it for him, pretending
to be so outrageously stupid to hide the fact that he actually didn't understand
hat was going on, and really being genuinely stupid.  He was renowned for
being quite clever and quite clearly was so -- but not all the time, which
obviously worried him, hence the act.  He preferred people to be puzzled
rather than contemptuous.  This above all appeared to Trillian to be
genuinely stupid, but she could no longer be bothered to argue about.

Our schizophrenic societies progress by knowledge but survive on inspiration
derived from the very beliefs which that knowledge erodes.  I suggest that the
paradox can be at least intellectually resolved, not all at once but eventually
and with consequences difficult to perfect, if we pay due attention to the
sociobiology of religion. Although the manifestations of the religious
experiences are resplendent and multidimensional and so complicated that the
finest of psychoanalyst and philosophers get lost in their labyrinth, I
believe that religious practices can be mapped onto the two dimensions of
genetic advantage and evolutionary change.

Perhaps the best way to characterize the relationship between DNA and meaning
is to say that DNA is the source of meaning.  It takes information about the
environment and turns it into behaviour - thus realizing meaning in the
pragmatic sense of the word.  DNA is the place where the two sides of meaning
meet, the place where reports become instructions.  DNA is thus what first
gave meaning to life; or, perhaps, what first created meaning, and therefore
life, or what first created life, and therefore meaning.  In any event, it is
very impressive stuff.

invented hell -- mouths mercy and invented hell -- mouths Golden Rules, and
forgiveness multiplied by seventy times seven, and invented hell; who frowns
upon crimes, yet commits them all; who created man without invitation, then

Surely every human being ought to attain to the dignity of the unit.  Surely
it is worth while to be one, and to feel that the census of the universe
would be incomplete without counting you.  Surely there is grandeur in knowing
that in the realm of thought you are without a chain; that you have the right
to explore all heights and all depths; that there are no walls or fences, or
prohibited places, or sacred corners in all the vast expanse of thought; that
your intellect owes no allegiance to any being, human or divine; that you
hold all in fee, and upon no condition, and by no tenure, whatsoever; that
in the world of mind you are relieved from all personal dictation, and from
the ignorant tyranny of majorities.  Surely it is worth something to feel that
there are no priests, no popes, no parties, no governments, no kings, no gods,
to whom your intellect can be compelled to pay a reluctant homage.  Surely it
is a joy to know that all the cruel ingenuity of bigotry can devise no prison,
no dungeon, no cell in which for one instant to confine a thought; that ideas
cannot be dislocated by racks, nor crushed in iron boots, nor burned with
fire.  Surely it is sublime to think that the brain is a castle, and that
within its curious bastions and winding halls the soul, in spite of all worlds
and all beings, is the supreme sovereign of itself.

A friend was being relocated from San Francisco to Athens, Greece for a two
year assignment. The relocation policy allowed him to bring up to 10,000 pounds
of possessions in each direction. However to prevent abuse he was allowed to
bring back only 1.5 times as much as he brought. Since he only owned about
2,500 pounds he called the VP Personnel at the East Coast headquarters and with
a terrific noise in the background shouted:

Friend: "Do I have this right. I can bring 10,000 pounds back from Greece, but

VP:	"That's right."
Friend: "Well, I'm here at the South San Francisco Scrap Iron Works, and they

 forget to wear shirt altogether.  If a professor is wearing blue
 jeans and suspenders, ten to one he is a physicist.  Physics profs
 often have German accents, but this is not a distingushing
 characteristic.  Be wary of psychologists with fake Viennese accents
  which can sound similar to the unwary.

Bio Prof: Sometimes wears a lab coat, though usually this is the
 sign of a biochemist.  Marine biologists walk around in hip boots
 for no explainable reason, even in the middle of winter.  They
 are apt to wear grey slacks and smell like fish, as opposed to
 most biologists, who smell strongly of formalin.  Microbiology
 instructors go around in spotless white coats, refuse to drink
 beer on tap, and wipe all their silverware before using it.
 Never loan money to a bio prof, no matter how much he asks.

Psych Prof: Psychologists are not real scientists, and can be
 easily identified by their screams of protest whenever anyone
 questions whether psychology is a science.  Psych people have
 beady little eyes and don't laugh at jokes about psychology.
 If you are not sure whether a person is a scientist or a
 comparative religion instructor, he is probably a psychologist.

CS Prof: Most CS profs are from India or Pakistan.  You can tell
 by the gestures and accents.  This is not a bad thing, though many
 of the American CS professors tend to pick up Indian accents which
 confounds more specific identification.  Like mushrooms, CS students
 only come out at night, and, if not Indian, tend to take on a
 pasty appearance.  CS professors do not use computers and therefore
 can be easily identified by their comparative good health with
 respect to their students.  Many CS professors do not even know how
 to use computers, and are actually mathematicians or psychologists
 in disguise.  Avoid these people.

Math Prof:  Math profs are like physics professors except without
 any practical bent.  A math professor will have only books and
 pencils in his office, as opposed to the piles of broken equipment
 that physicists keep.  Mathematicians scorn the use of computers
 and calculators and often have difficulty splitting bills in
 restaurants.  The easy way to identify a mathematician is by the
 common use of the phrases "It can be shown that..." and "Is left
 as an exercise to the student..."

A Rabbi, a Priest, and a Minister decide to go fishing.  They get into a
rowboat and go out onto the lake some distance.

They're getting ready to fish and the Priest says "I forgot my tackle
box on the shore.  Wait here, I'll be right back."  The Priest jumps out
of the boat and runs across the top of the water, grabs his tackle box,
and runs back across the water into the boat.

The Rabbi is quite amazed at what he just witnessed.

The Minister then says "I forgot my rod on the shore.  Wait right here,
I'll be back."  The Minister jumps out of the boat and runs across the
top of the water, grabs his rod, and runs back across the water into the boat.

The Rabbi is even more astonished, and figures, if they can do it, so
can I.

The Rabbi then says "I forgot my bait on the shore.  Wait right here, and
I'll be back."  The Rabbi steps out of the boat onto the water and sinks
to the bottom.

The Priest looks at the Minister and says "I guess he didn't know where
the rocks were."

Several recently deceased people were standing in front of the
pearly gates awaiting admission to heaven. St. Peter announced that
a final short quiz was necessary prior to entering to be sure that
the people learned at least a little about religion before they
died.

St. Peter asked a man what Easter meant to him.

"Easter," replied the man, "is a very important holiday. You bake a
turkey, have the family over for dinner and give thanks for the good
things that you have in life."

"No, no, no," said St. Peter and he sent the man to purgatory. He
then asked another man what Easter was.

"Easter," answered the second man, "is a wonderful time of the year
when you decorate a tree, sing carols and exchange gifts!"

"No, no, no" exclaimed St. Peter in desperation. "Doesn't anyone
here know what Easter is?"

"You," said St. Peter, pointing to a third man, "can you tell me
what Easter is?"

"Certainly I can" the third man answered pointedly. "Easter is when
the Lord Jesus Christ is buried in a cave and after three days he
arises up out of the cave."

"Finally," exclaimed St. Peter, "Here is a man who truely
understands what Easter is."

"Yes," said the third man, "and if Jesus sees his shadow and jumps
back into the cave we have 6 more weeks of winter...

A scientist is trying to determine how much each of a frog's
legs contribute to the frog's ability to jump. He places a frog
on a calibrated screen and claps his hands.

"Frog , Jump!," he yells.

The frog leaps into the air. The scientist notes where he lands
in his book - with 4 legs frog jumps 20 inches. He then removes
one leg and repeats the test.

"Frog , Jump!," he yells as he claps his hands.

The frog once again leaps into the air. Once more the scientist
notes the results in his book - with 3 legs frog jumps 15 inches.
The experiment is repeated until all of the frogs legs have been
removed. The scientist places the frog on the test stand one last
time.

"Frog , Jump!," he yells and claps.

There is no response.

"Frog , Jump!," he yells louder.

Again there is no response. After several more tries at prompting
the frog, the scientist gives up with a sigh. He notes in his
book - with no legs frog is deaf.

The college faculty were in their annual meeting when, suddenly, an angel
appears.  Turning to the Dean, the creature said, "I will grant you one
of three boons -- infinite wisdom, infinite wealth or infinite health."
The Dean thought for a minute, then replied "Wisdom."

"So be it." and the angel disappeared.

In the silence that followed, the Dean sat thoughtfully, saying nothing and
staring off into the distance.  Finally, one of the other faculty members
exclaimed, "Do you have anything to say? What words of wisdom can you
provide us?".

Quoth the Dean, "I should have taken the money."

A burglar has just made it into the house he's intending ransacking, and he's
looking around for stuff to steal.  All of a sudden, a little voice pipes up

"I can see you, and so can Jesus!"

Startled, the burglar looks around the room.  No-one there at all, so he goes
back to his business.

"I can see you, and so can Jesus!"

The burglar jumps again, and takes a longer look around the room.  Over in
the corner by the window, almost obscured by curtains, is a cage in which sits
a budgie, who pipes up again

"I can see you, and so can Jesus!"

"So what", says the burglar, "You're only a budgie!"

To which the budgie replies "Maybe, but Jesus is a Rottweiler!"

ARIES (March 21-April 20):  This month the bull-headed ram charges straight
  into trouble.  Be extra careful with motion on the third.  Tell the
  police it wasn't your fault.  A moonchild on the jury will acquit.
%
TAURUS (April 21-May 21):  Venus in your house of money spells a new career
  for you, Taurean.  Looks like you'll be working those mean streets for
  a while--but the money will be mmm-mmm, good!  Try to find a nice Leo
  pimp to keep an eye out while you bring home the bacon.  On the other
  hand, if you're a man, you're going to prison.  Tough break.
%
GEMINI (May 22-June 21):  All Geminis are two-faced scum, especially
  my ex-boyfriend.  DIE DIE DIE, you lousy bastard!  A Capricorn native
  will dance on your grave.
%
CANCER (June 22-July 23):  This month, sensitive Cancer is more sensitive
  than usual.  Mercury transiting your natal Scorpio turns you into a
  rotten, unpleasant bitch.  Others will notice and comment.  Your
  first instinct will be to act out that Mars in Taurus urge to
  strike back.  Sit down and shut up instead.  Nobody wants to hear
  it.  Pay particular attention to advice given by a Leo on the
  twentieth.  Re-think that parole violation you're contemplating.
%
LEO (July 24-Aug 23):  Your leonine charms serve you particularly well
  this month, especially on the 31st, when you have a good chance to
  use the persuasive influence of the Moon transiting your natal Scorpio
  to find the willing sacrifice of your dreams.  Careful, though!  A
  law-abiding Libra wants to spoil your fun!  You're the king of the
  jungle, though, Leo--so just kill the interfering bastard and get
  on with the show!
%
VIRGO (Aug 24-Sept 23):  It's official.  There aren't any left.
%
LIBRA (Sept 24-Oct 23):  Aren't you the birthday boy or girl?  And aren't
  you making a pain of yourself by reminding everyone that you're turning
  another year older?  The wise old Moon in your house of communication
  says shut up and let people remember on your own.  The Leos, of course,
  will forget, since they're busy thinking about themselves.  But--trust me--
  it's best to steer clear of Leo this month.  Besides, if people forget--
  so what?  You could use some humility--you're the biggest pain in
  the ass in the zodiac, Libra.  Lighten up.
%
SCORPIO (Oct 24-Nov 22):  Watch out for the impending Second Coming.
  Your underhanded schemes are about to fall apart.  A Capricorn
  native plays a big part.  Things heat up near the end of October,
  when Neptune transits your natal Saturn, sealing your eternal
  doom.  Sell all your possessions in the second week of October.
  You won't be needing them again.
%
SAGITTARIUS (Nov 23-Dec 21):  Uh-oh.  Somebody found out where that
  last arrow landed.  Expect a visit from Oliver Stone.  And
  beware of the Great Green Dragon.  A last-minute reprieve comes
  from a Piscean, possibly the one you drowned last month.
%
CAPRICORN (Dec 22-Jan 20):  Truly the jewel of the zodiac, the
  goat, as always, is in fine form this month.  A number of
  unpleasant folks from the past mysteriously disappear from
  the spotlight, leaving you free to get on with your bright
  future.  Neptune finally moves out of your twelfth house
  of the subconscious, enabling you to emerge from the schizophrenic
  haze you've been living in for so long.  Stop taking your
  medication.  It's just a plot by Pisceans to control you.
  The voices were right all along.
%
AQUARIUS (Jan 21-Feb 19):  As the new moon sets in, expect new
  opportunities to come with it.  Your water breaks on October
  tenth.
%
PISCES (Feb 20-March 20):  Maybe you shouldn't leave the house
  this month.  There are some real weirdos loose in the zodiac
  during the next 30 days.  Better to hide in the cellar until
  November.  Oh, wait.  I just took a glance at November.
  I'll get back to you.  Stay low.

We used to call Kernighan and Ritchie's "The C programming language"

C++ book is none other than "The Book of Mormon."

   The juvenile sea squirt wanders through the sea searching for

Wall Street analysts are like Lamb Chop the hand puppet.
Lamb Chop is cute. Lamb Chop is the star talent.  But, you
don't want to hear Lamb Chop's big, blonde, bouffanted
human friend say anything.

Then again, Lamb Chop never told you to suffocate your
parents as they slept at night. She never poked fun at her
owner's frosty eye shadow.  You got the feeling that Lamb
Chop had a whole lot of things to say, but that some
greater force manufactured her words.
