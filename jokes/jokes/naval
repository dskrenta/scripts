The three big ones in life are wealth, health, and happiness.
We pursue them in that order but their importance is in the reverse.
%
You can have the mind or you can have the moment.
%
Ego is false confidence, self-respect is true confidence
%
No one can compete with you on being you.
Most of life is a search for who and what needs you the most.
%
A rational person can find peace by cultivating indifference
to things outside of their control.
%
Success is the enemy of learning. It can deprive you of the time and the
incentive to start over. Beginner’s mind also needs beginner’s time.
%
Escape competition through authenticity.
%
The heart decides, the head rationalizes.
%
The fundamental delusion — there is something out there
that will make you happy and fulfilled forever.
%
All the benefits in life come from compound interest —
money, relationships, habits — anything of importance.
%
The compound interest from many quick small iterations is greater than the
compound interest from a few slow big iterations. Compound interest operates
in most intellectual and social domains.
%
Relax. You’ll live longer *and* perform better.
%
Twitter is television for intellectuals.
%
If you can't decide, the answer is No.
%
You don’t get rich by spending your time to save money.
You get rich by saving your time to make money.
%
Trade money for time, not time for money.
You’re going to run out of time first.
%
Seek wealth, not money or status.
Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep.
Money is how we transfer time and wealth.
Status is your place in the social hierarchy.
%
Work as hard as you can.
Even though who you work with and what you work
on are more important than how hard you work.
%
It is the mark of a charalatan to explain a simple concept in a complex way
%
Self-image is the prison. Other people are the guards.
%
The greatest superpower is the ability to change yourself.
%
We say “peace of mind” but really what we want is peace from mind.
%
A fit body, a calm mind, a house full of love.
These things cannot be bought — they must be earned.
%
Founders run every sprint as if they’re about to lose,
but grind out the long race knowing that victory is inevitable.
%
It's never been easier to start a company.
It's never been harder to build one.
%
An early exit for your startup is a mirage in the desert.
If you thirst for it, it disappears.
%
Read what you love until you love to read.
%
Wealth creation is an evolutionarily recent positive-sum game.
Status is an old zero-sum game.
Those attacking wealth creation are often just seeking status.
%
The reality is life is a single-player game. You’re born alone.
You’re going to die alone. All of your interpretations are alone.
All your memories are alone.
You’re gone in three generations and nobody cares.
Before you showed up, nobody cared. It’s all single-player.
%
Become the best in the world at what you do.
Keep redefining what you do until this is true.
%
In an age of infinite leverage, judgement is the most important skill.
%
Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.
%
Once you’ve truly controlled your own fate, for better or for worse,
you’ll never let anyone else tell you what to do.
%
You will get rich by giving society what it wants but
does not yet know how to get. At scale.
%
People who try to look smart by pointing out obvious exceptions
actually signal the opposite.
%
The selfish reason to be ethical is that it attracts the other
ethical people in the network.
%
There are no get rich quick schemes.
That’s just someone else getting rich off you.
%
Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity
and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.
%
Better to find a new audience than to write for the audience.
%
Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.
%
A taste of freedom can make you unemployable.
%
Your closest friends are the ones you can have a relationship
with about nothing.
%
'Consensus' is just another way of saying 'average'.
%
Morality and ethics automatically emerge when we realize the long term
consequences of our actions.
%
The best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed.
They are creative expressions of continuous learners in free markets.
%
The skills you really want can’t be taught, but they can be learned.
%
Building technology means you don’t have to choose between practicing science, commerce, and art.
%
Twitter is a much better resumé than LinkedIn.
%
It is the mark of a charlatan to explain a simple concept in a complex way
%
Free education is abundant, all over the internet.
It’s the desire to learn that’s scarce.
%
The internet is the best school ever created.
The best peers are on the Internet.
The best books are on the Internet.
The best teachers are on the Internet.
The tools for learning are abundant.
It’s the desire to learn that’s scarce.
%
Teaching is more a way for the teacher to learn than for the student to learn.
%
A busy mind accelerates the passage of subjective time.
%
All the value in life, including in relationships, comes from
compound interest.
%
The first rule of handling conflict is don't hang around with people
who are constantly engaging in conflict.
%
If you want to be successful, surround yourself with people who are more
successful than you are, but if you want to be happy, surround yourself
with people who are less successful than you are.
%
Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people.
%
The most important trick to be happy is to realize that happiness
is a choice that you make and a skill set that you develop.
You choose to be happy, and then you work at it.
It's just like building muscles.
%
Don’t do things that you know are morally wrong.
Not because someone is watching, but because you are.
Self-esteem is just the reputation that you have with yourself.
You’ll always know.
%
If you create intersections, you’re going to have collisions.
%
The right to debate should not be up for debate.
%
Knowledge is discovered by all of us, each adding to the whole.
Wisdom is rediscovered by each of us, one at a time.
%
My 1 repeated learning in life: "There Are No Adults"
Everyone's making it up as they go along.
Figure it out yourself, and do it.
%
Making money through an early lucky trade is the worst way to win.
The bad habits that it reinforces will lead to a lifetime of losses.
%
Forty hour workweeks are a relic of the Industrial Age.
Knowledge workers function like athletes — train and sprint,
then rest and reassess.
%
Information is everywhere but its meaning is created by
the observer that interprets it. Meaning is relative and
there is no objective, over-arching meaning.
%
If you’re more passionate about founding a business than the business itself,
you can fall into a ten year trap.  Better to stay emotionally unattached and
select the best opportunity that arises. Applies to relationships too.
%
Smart money is just dumb money that’s been through a crash.
%
The secret to public speaking is to speak as if you were alone.
%
Notifications are just alarm clocks that someone else is setting for you.
%
The best way, perhaps the only way, to change others is to become an example.
%
Sophisticated foods are bittersweet (wine, beer, coffee, chocolate).
Addictive relationships are cooperative and competitive.
Work becomes flow at the limits of ability.
The flavor of life is on the edge.
%
I think the best way to prepare for the future 20 years is find something you
love to do, to have a shot at being one of the best people in the world at it.
Build an independent brand around it, with your name.
%
Technology is not only the thing that moves the human race forward, but it’s
the only thing that ever has. Without technology, we’re just monkeys playing
in the dirt.
%
Success is the enemy of learning. It can deprive you of the time and the
incentive to start over. Beginner’s mind also needs beginner’s time.
%
Don’t debate people in the media when you can debate them in the marketplace.
%
Twitter is a way to broadcast messages to hundreds of millions of people to
find the few dozen that you actually want to talk to.
%
A contrarian isn’t one who always objects — that’s a confirmist of a
different sort. A contrarian reasons independently, from the ground up,
and resists pressure to conform.
%
The real struggle isn’t proletariat vs bourgeois. It’s between high-status
elites and wealthy elites. When their cooperation breaks, revolution.
%
Branding requires accountability. To build a great personal brand
(an eponymous one), you must take on the risk of being publicly wrong.
%
If you're going to pick 3 cards in the hand you're dealt, take intelligence,
drive, and most importantly, emotional self-discipline.
%
Before you can lie to another, you must first lie to yourself.
%
Wealth creation is an evolutionarily recent positive-sum game. Status is an
old zero-sum game. Those attacking wealth creation are often just seeking
status.
%
The tools for learning are abundant. It’s the desire to learn that’s scarce.
%
This is such a short and precious life that it’s really important that you
don’t spend it being unhappy.
%
You make your own luck if you stay at it long enough.
%
The power to make and break habits and learning how to do that is
really important.
%
Happiness is a choice and a skill and you can dedicate yourself to learning
that skill and making that choice.
%
We’re not really here for that long and we don’t really matter that much.
And nothing that we do lasts. So eventually you will fade. Your works will fade.
Your children will fade. Your thoughts will fade. This planet will fade. The
sun will fade. It will all be gone.
%
The first rule of handling conflict is don’t hang around people who are
constantly engaging in conflict.
%
The problem happens when we have multiple desires. When we have fuzzy desires.
When we want to do ten different things and we’re not clear about which is the
one we care about.
%
People spend too much time doing and not enough time thinking about what they
should be doing.
%
The people who succeed are irrationally passionate about something.
%
I don’t plan. I’m not a planner. I prefer to live in the moment and be free
and to flow and to be happy.
%
If you see a get rich quick scheme, that’s someone else trying to get rich off
of you.
%
If you try to micromanage yourself all you’re going to do is make yourself
miserable.
%
Social media has degenerated into a deafening cacophony of groups signaling
and repeating their shared myths.
%
If it entertains you now but will bore you someday, it’s a distraction. Keep looking.
%
If the primary purpose of school was education, the Internet should
obsolete it.  But school is mainly about credentialing.
%
Desire is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get
what you want.
%
Technology is applied science.
Science is the study of nature.
Mathematics is the language of nature.
Philosophy is the root of mathematics.
All tightly interrelated.
%
Be present above all else.
%
Who you do business with is just as important as what you choose to do.
%
If you can’t see yourself working with someone for life, don’t work with
them for a day.
%
Time is the ultimate currency and I should have been more tight fisted
with it.
%
Impatience is a virtue. Self-discipline is another form of self conflict.
Find things that excite you.
%
Earn with your mind, not your time.
%
Humans are basically habit machines. I think learning how to break habits is
actually a very important meta skill and can serve you in life almost better
than anything else.
%
The older the problem, the older the solution.
%
Humans aren’t evolved to worry about everything happening outside of
their immediate environment.
%
It’s the mark of a charlatan to try and explain simple things in complex ways
and it’s the mark of a genius to explain complicated things in simple ways.
%
The Efficient Markets Hypothesis fails because humans are herd animals,
not independent rational actors. Thus the best investors tend to be
antisocial and contrarian.
%
You’re never going to get rich renting out your time.
%
Lots of literacy in modern society, but not enough numeracy.
%
Above “product-market fit” is “founder-product-market fit.
%
Good copy is a poor substitute for good UI. Good marketing is a
poor substitute for a good product.
%
Software is gnawing on Venture Capital.
%
Society has had multiple stores of value, as none is perfectly secure.
Gold, oil, dollars, real estate, (some) bonds & equities. Crypto is
the first that’s decentralized *and* digital.
%
Crypto is a bet against the modern macroeconomic dogma, which is
passed off as science, but is really a branch of politics —
with rulers, winners, and losers.
%
The overeducated are worse off than the undereducated, having traded common
sense for the illusion of knowledge.
%
School, politics, sports, and games train us to compete against others.
True rewards - wealth, knowledge, love, fitness, and equanimity -
come from ignoring others and improving ourselves.
%
If you eat, invest, and think according to what the ‘news’ advocates,
you’ll end up nutritionally, financially and morally bankrupt.
%
If you’re more passionate about founding a business than the business itself,
you can fall into a ten year trap. Better to stay emotionally unattached and
select the best opportunity that arises.
%
Your goal in life is to find out the people who need you the most, to find
out the business that needs you the most, to find the project and the art
that needs you the most. There is something out there just for you.
%
Yoga cultivates Peace of Body. Meditation cultivates Peace of Mind.
%
Judgement requires experience, but can be built faster by learning
foundational skills.
%
Tell your friends that you're a happy person. Then you'll be forced to
conform to it. You'll have a consistency bias. You have to live up to it.
Your friends will expect you to be a happy person.
%
Clear thinkers appeal to their own authority.
%
Think clearly from the ground up. Understand and explain from first
principles. Ignore society and politics. Acknowledge what you have.
Control your emotions.
%
Cynicism is easy. Mimicry is easy. Optimistic contrarians are the
rarest breed.
%
If they can train you to do it, then eventually they will train a computer
to do it.
%
A great goal in life would be to not have to be in a given place at a
given time... Being accountable for your output rather than your input.
I would love to be paid purely for my judgment.
%
If you’re desensitized to the fact that you’re going to die, consider it
a different way. As far as you’re concerned, this world is going to end.
Now what?
%
Following your genuine intellectual curiosity is a better foundation for a
career than following whatever is making money right now.
%
Objectively, the world is improving. To the elites, it’s falling apart
as their long-lived institutions are flattened by the Internet.
%
One of the most damaging and widespread social beliefs is the idea that
most adults are incapable of learning new skills.
%
A personal metric: how much of the day is spent doing things out of
obligation rather than out of interest?
%
Caught in a funk? Use meditation, music, and exercise to reset your mood.
Then choose a new path to commit emotional energy for rest of day.
%
To be honest, speak without identity.
%
A rational person can find peace by cultivating indifference to things
outside of their control.
%
Politics is sports writ large — pick a side, rally the tribe, exchange
stories confirming bias, hurl insults and threats at the other side.
%
People who live far below their means enjoy a freedom that people
busy upgrading their lifestyles can’t fathom.
%
We feel guilt when we no longer want to associate with old friends and
colleagues who haven’t changed. The price, and marker, of growth.
%
Anger is a hot coal that you hold in your hand while waiting to throw it
at someone else.
%
All the real benefits of life come from compound interest.
%
Total honesty at all times. It’s almost always possible to be
honest & positive.
%
Truth is that which has predictive power.
%
Watch every thought. Always ask, why am I having this thought?
%
All greatness comes from suffering.
%
Love is given, not received.
%
Enlightenment is the space between your thoughts.
%
Mathematics is the language of nature.
%
Every moment has to be complete in and of itself.
%
So I have no time for short-term things: dinners with people I won’t see
again, tedious ceremonies to please tedious people, traveling to places
that I wouldn’t go to on vacation.
%
You can change it, you can accept it, or you can leave it. What is not a good
option is to sit around wishing you would change it but not changing it,
wishing you would leave it but not leaving it, and not accepting it. It’s that
struggle, that aversion, that is responsible for most of our misery. The
phrase that I use the most to myself in my head is one word: accept.
%
I don’t have time is just saying it’s not a priority.
%
Happiness is a state where nothing is missing.
%
If you don’t love yourself who will?
%
If being ethical were profitable everybody would do it.
%
Someone who is using a lot of fancy words and big concepts probably doesn’t
know what they’re talking about. The smartest people can explain things to a
child; if you can’t do that, you don’t understand the concept.
%
Signaling virtue is a vice.
%
Investing favors the dispassionate. Markets efficiently separate emotional
investors from their money.
%
Reality is neutral. Our reactions reflect back and create our world. Judge,
and feel separate and lonely. Anger, and lose peace of mind. Cling, and live
in anxiety. Fantasize, and miss the present. Desire, and suffer until you
have it. Heaven and hell are right here, right now.
%
Knowledge is a skyscraper. You can take a shortcut with a fragile foundation
of memorization, or build slowly upon a steel frame of understanding.
%
A busy mind accelerates the perceived passage of time. Buy more time
by cultivating peace of mind.
%
Politics is the exercise of power without merit.
%
Politics and merit are opposite ends of a spectrum. More political
organizations are less productive, have less inequality, and top
performers opt out. More merit based organizations have higher
productivity, more inequality, and higher odds of internal fracture.
%
Doctors won’t make you healthy.
Nutritionists won’t make you slim.
Teachers won’t make you smart.
Gurus won’t make you calm.
Mentors won’t make you rich.
Trainers won’t make you fit.
Ultimately, you have to take responsibility.
Save yourself.
%
You have to surrender, at least a little bit, to be the best version
of yourself possible.
